# Search

## Filtered Searches

Filtered searches can be used to find entities that match specific search criteria.

## Usage

>Filter Construct

```json
{
  "filter_rules": [
    {
      "property": "_name_",
      "operator": "_operator_",
      "value": "_value_"
    }
  ]
}
```

<span class="http-method http-post">POST</span> `_entity_/filtered`

>Filters can be combined together as follows:

```json
{
  "filter_rules": [
    {
      "property": "_name_",
      "operator": "_operator_",
      "value": "_value_"
    },
    {
      "property": "_name_",
      "operator": "_operator_",
      "value": "_value_"
    }
  ]
}
```

  Filtered requests can combine filter rules with sorting rules by adding both properties to the payload.

## Sorting

>Sorting Construct

```json
 "sorting_rules": [
    {
      "property": "description",
      "direction": "desc"
    },
    {
      "property": "code",
      "direction": "asc"
    }
  ]
```

Results from filtered searches can be sorted using filtered actions with sorting rules.
